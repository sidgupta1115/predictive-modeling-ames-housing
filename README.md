# Predictive Modeling for Residential Housing prices in Ames, Iowa

## There are two components of this project:

1. Estimated the sale price of properties based on their "fixed" characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories, etc.
2. Estimated the value of possible changes and renovations to properties from the variation in sale price not explained by the fixed characteristics. Predicted the potential return on investment when making specific improvements to properties.

The Jupyter Notebook goes into detail on the analysis and regression modeling methods used.

This project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
